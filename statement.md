# 📄 Project Statement: Academic Assignment Reminder System

## Problem Statement
Students often manage assignments from *disparate sources* (Learning Management Systems, email, personal notes, verbal instructions from lecturers), leading to a *fragmented view* of their total workload. This lack of a single, reliable tracking system significantly increases the risk of *missed deadlines, contributes to unnecessary academic stress, and ultimately has a negative impact on **academic performance* and planning. The goal of this project is to solve the problem of information fragmentation by providing a dedicated, centralized platform.

## Scope of the Project
This project is scoped to provide a robust, centralized application for managing academic deadlines and providing reliable, automated reminders.

### Included in Scope:
* *User Authentication:* Secure user registration, login, and profile management.
* *Core CRUD Operations:* Full creation, reading, updating, and deletion of assignment data (Title, Course, Due Date/Time, Priority).
* *Reliable Notification Delivery:* Automated, scheduled reminders delivered to the user.
* *Visual Dashboard:* A unified view for workload tracking, including status and completion statistics.
* *Database Schema Design:* Implementation of a proper relational schema for persistence.

### Excluded from Scope (Future Enhancements):
* Direct API integration with external Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Moodle or Canvas.
* Mobile application development (focus is solely on a responsive web interface).
* Collaborative features between users (e.g., shared lists).

## Target Users
The primary and sole target users are *University and College Students* who are enrolled in multiple courses and require a reliable, independent tool for managing their time and complex academic schedules.

## High-level Features
1.  *Centralized Deadline Entry:* A single point of input for tracking all assignment data.
2.  *Visual Workload Tracking:* Easy visualization of pending tasks via a list or simplified calendar view.
3.  *Automated Notifications:* Guaranteed and configurable delivery of reminders at critical time intervals.
4.  *Completion Tracking:* Ability to mark assignments as complete to update statistics and clear the active workload view.
